# FabricProxy
Fabric mod for support forward player data from proxy

## Deprecated
**This mod no longer maintained, recommended to use [FabricProxy-Lite] instead.**
**If you still want the support for Bungeecord(and only for Bungeecord, not Velocity) on high Minecraft version, you can try [StarLight-FabricProxy]**

Because BungeeCord is not compatible with Fabric-API and most mods, I decided to drop BungeeCord support.

And this mod using some mixin conflict with Fabric-API. That is why create [FabricProxy-Lite].

This mod still work but will not actively maintain, pull request still accept.
