# FabricProxy
Fabric mod for support forward player data from proxy

## Deprecated
**This mod no longer maintained, recommended to use [FabricProxy-Lite](https://github.com/OKTW-Network/FabricProxy-Lite) instead.**

Because BungeeCord is not compatible with Fabric-API and most mods, I decided to drop BungeeCord support.

And this mod using some mixin conflict with Fabric-API. That is why create [FabricProxy-Lite].

This mod still work but will not actively maintain, pull request still accept.

### Third-party forks
